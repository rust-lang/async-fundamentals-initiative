# 🔬 Evaluation

> The *evaluation* surveys the various design approaches that are under consideration.
It is not required for all initiatives, only those that begin with a problem statement
but without a clear picture of the best solution. Often the evaluation will refer to topics
in the [design-discussions] for more detailed consideration.
